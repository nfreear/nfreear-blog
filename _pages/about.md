I'm Nick Freear, a _Senior Accessibility and Usability Consultant_ at [AbilityNet][].

Until August 2021, I was an Educational Technology (Web) developer in the
[Institute of Educational Technology][iet] at [The Open University][].
I am passionate about Web standards and accessibility.
Projects to which I've contributed include [Moodle][], [Drupal][], [WordPress][]
and [CloudEngine][] -- all [free][] / open-source projects.

And, I wrote the book [Moodle 2 for Teaching 4-9 Year Olds Beginner's Guide][book], published by Packt.

I live in Milton Keynes with my wife and daughter, and do some cycling, kayaking and singing.
