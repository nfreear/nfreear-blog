> Can you help save my daughters from deportation?
> I am a British citizen who's family comes from [Diego Garcia][], a British island in the India Ocean.
> My family were forcibly removed from the island 50 years ago to make way for an American air base.
> Now my daughters, who are 16 and 18, are not afforded the right of
> British citizenship by the UK Government and are facing deportation.
> We have no family anywhere else and they have nowhere to go.
> Can you help me raise money to pay for legal help to apply for their citizenship and keep my family together?
