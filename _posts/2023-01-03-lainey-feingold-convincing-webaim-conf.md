<!-- Today at 17:50, Slack -->
I had some spare time today, so watched [Lainey Feingold: Accessibility Convincing. Web Accessibility In Mind Conference][lainey-vid-yt] -- V. good talk, which I think counts towards [CAECs for IAAP][iaap].

Lot's of useful points she made. “#2 Do understand who you're convincing and speak their language” -- Lainey made the point, for example, pharmacists care about safety, so access(ibility) __is__ safety - Braille labels on medicine, or side-effects published in an accessible format on a website are about patients/customers not being made sick or worse. Access(ibility) __is__ security for Web developers – not having to share your password with someone just to log into a site, etc. Accessibility __is__ privacy/security for bankers.

Lainey also said, “DO talk about the law as a civil right” and _DO use ethics_ ... and _DO use kindness_ -- which I thought was particularly interesting :wink:

Also some good questions at the end, one of which led her to mention the [Procure Access initiative led by Disability:IN][paccess]. Some big names have signed up to [the statement][pa-state] -- Microsoft, Google, JP Morgan, Salesforce ... Twitter _(interesting!)_

I hope this is useful! :+1::skin-tone-2:

(Oh, and [Techshare Pro / Barclays][tsp] got a mention!)
