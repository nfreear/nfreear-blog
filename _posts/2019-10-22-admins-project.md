_"Assistants to the Disclosure and Management of Information about Needs and Support" (ADMINS)_

Colleagues in the [Institute of Educational Technology][iet],
including  [Tim Coughlan][] and [Kate Lister][] have been
[researching the impact of administrative processes on the wellbeing of disabled students][oro-2018].
One of the outcomes of this has been the [Our Journey][] project I blogged about previously.

Another outcome is the [Microsoft][ms]-funded [ADMINS project][], which runs until September 2020.
This involves exciting research into the use of [chatbot][], [language understanding][luis]
and other cognitive services to assist students to inform the University about
their health conditions and disabilities, and their needs.

We're just starting out, and we're running into some challenges relating to ethics, data privacy &hellip;
And, lot's of new concepts and terms like [diarization][dia], utterance and [intent][] &hellip; fun, fun!

My developer colleagues and I are looking to try [Typescript][] for this project.
I'll update the blog as we progress.
