At the moment I'm looking again at my stammer/ stutter, and my feeling and emotions about it.

In the 1970s, Dr. Joseph [Sheenan][] characterized a stammer as an [iceberg][],
with the relatively '_small_' visible indications of the struggle of stuttering above the surface,
and a great weight of negative thoughts and emotions that build up beneath.

Others have built on this analogy, with the [Iceberg Beast][] ([more][], another [image][]).

For me the visible traits are:

 * _Blocking_ — this is the basic character of my stammer now, and has been for a long time;
 * _Repetition_ — I don't do much of this now — I did a lot when I was younger (the classic "_p-p-please_");
 * _Physical tension_ — in my neck, shoulders, jaw ...;
 * _Avoidance_ — I try to do less of this — avoiding situations (e.g. _phone calls_), sounds, words;

The invisible baggage:

 * _Anger_ — less of this now, I'm glad to say;
 * _Resentment_ — I'm trying to reduce this;
 * _Denial_ — I don't think I've told people, or myself, how much my stammer has shaped me, and my life, and how unhappy it's made me feel at times;
 * _Frustration_ — some;
 * _Shame, hopelessness, anxiety ..._ — a problem when I was in my teens, less now?!
 * _Isolation_ — again, in my pre-teens, teens, twenties ... I have more support now;
 * _Self-reproach_ — I only thought of this recently!
 * _Fear_ — maybe some lingers?

_Does this help you?_
