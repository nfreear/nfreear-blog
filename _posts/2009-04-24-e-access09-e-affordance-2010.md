The [e-access '09 conference][e-access09] at Olympia yesterday (Thursday) provided a wide selection of speakers and much food for thought. The organising team at [Headstar][] and the Olympia staff made us very welcome. Below I've tried to capture some key words and phrases, with notes on their context and implications.

## Humble

Said by Graeme Whippy, Senior Manager for Lloyds TSB IT Accessibility Group. He spoke eloquently about setting up the Group and the work of the UK [Business Taskforce on Accessible Technology][taskforce] which brings together public sector, large corporates and technology suppliers like Microsoft and Adobe. Graeme spoke about their progress so far and the way ahead.

## Affordance

Said by [Bill Thompson][], technology critic and broadcaster. The argument was to stop treating accessibility as special and separate - it needs to be in the mainstream, as another facet of inclusive design and usability. There were citations of James Gibson who coined the term [Affordance][] (_The Theory of Affordances, 1977_) and [William Gaver][] of Goldsmiths ([Curious things for curious people][curious]).

## Empathy

Said by Nina Warburton, Director at [The Alloy][], in relation to the design of mobile phones - and the many problems with over-featured and touch-screen handsets. In defence of 20-something male "able-bodied" product designers, Nina pointed out that she saw young, potentially empathetic designers who are educated in inclusive design and [applied gerontology][ger]. The commonly have the passion beaten out of them by commercial pressure.

## Customizable

Said by [Shadi Abou-Zahra][shadi], [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)][w3c] Web Accessibility Specialist, about the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2, customizable quick reference][quick]. This is a real boon for developers.

Look out for [detailed articles][eab] by Dan Jellinek and colleagues in the monthly [E-Access Bulletin][arch].
